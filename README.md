# JobBoardPortal
A job board portal built with MERN stack  

The frontend was built with the help of REACT, TailwindCSS, headless UI, redux for state management and cloudinary to manage our assets.
The backend was built using the MVC approach and utilises Node.js, MongoDB and JWT for authentication.

For the deployment of the project we leveraged netlify for the frontend and render for the backend.
